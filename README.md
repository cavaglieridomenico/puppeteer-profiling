# Puppeteer Profiling

This project provides a setup to connect Puppeteer to a Chrome instance running on an Android device, allowing for remote debugging and performance tracing.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js and npm:** [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Version 18.17.0 or higher is required for Puppeteer).
- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB):** You do **not** need the full Android SDK.
  - **Download:** Get the standalone **SDK Platform-Tools** package for your OS from the [official Google developer site](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools).
  - **Install:** Extract the folder to a known location (e.g., `C:\platform-tools`).
  - **Configuration:** The project looks for `adb` in the following order:
    1.  **`ADB_PATH` (Recommended):** Set this environment variable to your specific executable path (e.g., `set ADB_PATH=C:\platform-tools\adb.exe`).
    2.  **System PATH:** If you added the folder to your global PATH.
    3.  **Android SDK:** Checks `ANDROID_HOME` or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` if a full SDK is present.
  - **PowerShell Users:** If running commands manually from the platform-tools folder, you may need to prefix them with `.\` (e.g., `.\adb devices`).
- **A physical Android device:** With **USB debugging enabled** and connected to your computer.
  - _Note:_ Ensure Chrome is installed and running on the device before starting the script.

## Setup

1.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Connect your Android device:**

    Ensure your Android device is connected via USB and USB debugging is enabled. Verify it's recognized by ADB:

    ```bash
    adb devices
    ```

    You should see your device listed.

3.  **Forward the Chrome DevTools port (for mobile mode):**

    This command forwards the Chrome DevTools port from your Android device to your local machine (port 9222). This is only required if you intend to use the `mobile` mode.

    ```bash
    adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote
    ```

    Keep this command running in a dedicated terminal or ensure it's executed before starting the `index.js` script in `mobile` mode.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the `index.js` script to interact with Chrome on your Android device or a local desktop Chrome instance.

### 1. Start the Puppeteer connection and command server

You can start the script in either **mobile** or **desktop** mode. The command server for tracing will always run on port `8080`.

- **Mobile Mode (default):** Connects to Chrome on your Android device.

  ```bash
  npm start
  # or explicitly
  npm run start:mobile
  ```

  If no URL is provided, it will list the currently open tabs on your device.

- **Desktop Mode:** Launches a new local Chrome instance in maximized size, rendering as a full desktop view, with camera permissions automatically granted.
  ```bash
  npm run start:desktop
  ```
  If no URL is provided, it will open a blank page.

The script will keep the connection alive. To stop it, press `Ctrl+C`.

### 2. Control Tracing and Input (from a **second terminal**)

While the main script (`npm start`, `npm run start:mobile`, or `npm run start:desktop`) is running in your first terminal, you can use a second terminal to send commands to start and stop performance tracing, and to send input events.

> **Tip:** Refer to the `scripts` section in `package.json` for a complete list of all available manual and semi-automated commands (e.g., `npm run input:tap-vmmv-video`).

Trace files will be saved in your project directory with progressive numbering (e.g., `trace-0.json`, `trace-1.json`).

## Enabling Memory Profiling on Android device

For mobile devices, you need to manually enable memory profiling in Chrome before you can capture a trace with heap data. Here are the steps:

1.  **Connect your device:** Make sure your Android device is connected to your computer and that USB debugging is enabled.

2.  **Stop any running instance of Chrome:**

    ```bash
    .\adb shell am force-stop com.android.chrome
    ```

3.  **Set the command-line flags for Chrome:** This command tells Chrome to launch with the `--enable-memory-infra` flag.

    ```bash
    .\adb shell 'echo "chrome --enable-memory-infra" > /data/local/tmp/chrome-command-line'
    ```

4.  **Start Chrome and open a URL (Optional):** You can start Chrome with a specific URL.

    ```bash
    .\adb shell am start -n com.android.chrome/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main -d "https://your-url.com"
    ```

    If you don't want to open a specific URL, you can just start Chrome manually on your device or use this command:

    ```bash
    .\adb shell am start -n com.android.chrome/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main
    ```

5.  **Forward the DevTools port:** Keep this terminal window open.

    ```bash
    .\adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote
    ```

6.  **In a new terminal**, run the `start:mobile` script:
    ```bash
    npm run start:mobile
    ```

Now you can start and stop tracing, and the trace files will include memory profiling data.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Cannot connect to the device" error (Mobile Mode):**
  - Ensure your Android device is connected and USB debugging is enabled.
  - Verify `adb devices` lists your device.
  - Confirm that `adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote` was executed successfully and Chrome is running on your device.
- **"Cannot connect to the device" error (Desktop Mode):**
  - Ensure Puppeteer can launch Chrome on your desktop.
- **`curl` command not found:** If you are on Windows, you might need to use `Invoke-WebRequest` in PowerShell or install `curl` for Windows.
- **Port 9222 Already in Use:** If you get an error that port 9222 is already in use, you can find the process that is using the port and kill it.
  - **Find the process ID (PID):**
    ```bash
    netstat -ano | findstr "9222"
    ```
    This will show you the PID of the process using port 9222.
  - **Kill the process:**
    ```bash
    taskkill /PID 3596 /F
    ```
    Replace `3596` with the actual PID you found in the previous step.
